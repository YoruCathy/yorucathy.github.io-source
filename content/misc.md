I enjoy horseback riding. I am particularly interested in endurance and dressage. 

I have a black domestic long hair cat (Shiloh) and a yellow lab mix (Stella). Both of them are rescues. I enjoy spending time with them.

I am a huge musical theatre fan. 

I love making cocktails and had a well-stocked home bar with a variety of spirits. Unfortunately, I had to give up drinking for health reasons.

I played the Guzheng (a Chinese traditional musical instrument), guitar, and violin.

I belong to the [She people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_people), one of the 56 officially recognized ethnic minority groups in China. The name "She" (ç•²) means "guests in the mountains".
